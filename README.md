- [x] **Day 5-7: Basic Operations:**
  - Practice basic operations like arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and understand their implementation in C.

## Week 2: Control Structures and Functions

- [x] **Day 8-10: Conditional Statements (if-else):**
  - Explore conditional statements and their application in decision-making.
- [x] **Day 11-13: Loops (for, while, do-while):**
  - Understand the various loop constructs and practice using them for repetitive tasks.
- [x] **Day 14-15: Functions:**
  - Learn the basics of functions, including function declaration, definition, and usage.

## Week 3: Arrays and Pointers

- [x] **Day 16-18: Arrays:**
  - Dive into arrays, understanding their declaration, initialization, and manipulation.
- [x] **Day 19-21: Pointers Basics:**
  - Explore the concept of pointers, understand their importance, and practice simple pointer operations.
- [x] **Day 22-23: Pointers and Arrays:**
  - Understand the relationship between pointers and arrays, and practice using pointers with arrays.

## Week 4: Memory Management, Basic File Handling, and Projects

- [ ] **Day 24-25: Memory Allocation and Deallocation:**
  - Learn about memory allocation functions like malloc(), calloc(), and free(), and practice dynamic memory management.
- [ ] **Day 26-27: File Input and Output (I/O):**
  - Explore basic file handling in C, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
- [ ] **Day 28-30: Project Implementation and Review:**
  - Dedicate the remaining days to working on practical projects. Choose from the suggested projects or create your own based on the concepts learned. Review and refine your code, ensuring a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts.

### Project Suggestions:

1. [ ] **Simple Calculator:**

   - Implement a command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

2. [ ] **To-Do List Manager:**

   - Create a to-do list manager where users can add, remove, and view tasks. Store the tasks in a file for persistence.

3. [ ] **File Encryption/Decryption Tool:**

   - Build a program that can encrypt and decrypt text files using a simple encryption algorithm.

4. [ ] **Student Database System:**

   - Develop a student database system that allows users to add, delete, and search for student records.

5. [ ] **Guess the Number Game:**

   - Implement a simple "Guess the Number" game where the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it.

6. [ ] **Bank Management System:**

   - Create a basic banking system with features like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

7. [ ] **Text-Based Adventure Game:**

   - Design a text-based adventure game where users make choices that affect the outcome.

8. [ ] **Temperature Conversion Tool:**

   - Build a tool that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

9. [ ] **Simple Shell (Command-Line Interpreter):**

   - Develop a simple shell that can execute basic commands.

10. [ ] **Basic Chat Application:**
    - Create a simple command-line chat application where users can send and receive messages.

Remember to start with a simple version of each project and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the concepts. These projects will not only reinforce your C programming skills but also provide practical experience in building applications.
