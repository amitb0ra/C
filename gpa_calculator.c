TODO:
    Implement a GPA calculator program

    1. Declare variables to store course credits and grades
    2. Get user input for the number of courses
    3. Use a loop to input the credits and grades for each course
    4. Calculate the total credit hours and weighted grade points
    5. Calculate the GPA using the formula GPA = Total Weighted Grade Points / Total Credits
    6. Display the calculated GPA

EXTRAS:
    7. Test the program with various inputs
    8. Ensure the program handles edge cases and invalid inputs
    9. Consider additional features, such as letter grade conversion or cumulative GPA calculation
    10. Optimize the program for efficiency if necessary
